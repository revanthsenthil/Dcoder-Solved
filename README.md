# Dcoder
**Solutions** for problems and challenges from Dcoder. 
I have added the problem description as a 'comment'  in each code file.
This repo is just to store projects, challenges and examples I've encountered on Dcoder.
There is no set limit for languages used, but I'm starting with python and java.
